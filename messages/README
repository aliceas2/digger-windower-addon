The make_messages.py file is a Python 3.x script used to generate the
messages.lua file needed for digger. It will find the install folder for
the US version of the game in your registry and parse the DAT files to
find the relavent digging message IDs. Once it's complete move the new
messages.lua file to the digger addon folder.

The settings.py file tells the main script which messages to look for
and which zone dialog DAT files to search.
