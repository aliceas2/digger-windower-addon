This addon requires the Timers plugin to display your "recast" timer for
digging. It will also display statistics about your dig accuracy,
fatigue and remaining greens after each dig. The fatigue tracking will
also work properly with the Blue Racing Silks bonus.

To install this addon, create a folder called "digger" inside the
Windower addons folder and copy the digger.lua file there. Your addon
folder is most likely "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windower4\addons".

To load the addon, in the Final Fantasy XI input line, type:
    //lua load digger

The available commands are:
    digger rank <crafting rank>
        Sets your digging rank.
    digger reset
        Clears digging accuracy statistics.
