This addon requires the Timers plugin to display your "recast" timer for
digging. It will also display statistics about your dig accuracy,
fatigue and remaining greens after each dig. The fatigue tracking will
also work properly with the Blue Racing Silks bonus.

The available commands are:
    digger rank <crafting rank>
        Sets your digging rank.
    digger stats [clear]
        Displays or clears digging accuracy statistics.
